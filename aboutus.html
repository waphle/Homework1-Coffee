        <p id="infoText" align="center"> Jebediah Longtree was born on April 1, 1993 to immigrants from Cofilend, Iceland, a place
            known for their amazing coffee. Stephen Harvester, born on April 20, 1994 to a family with a history
            dating back to the American Revolutionary War, took upon brewing coffee after tasting the horrid
            fake coffee at his college's cafeteria. The two met when Stephen posted a discussion
            thread on WhyCoffeeNowadaysSuck.com, and Jebediah responded to Stephen's post.
            The two talked back and forth, and low and behold, the two happened to just live just a few blocks away from
            each other! They met and started to create their own brews, committing to create the best
            tasting coffee in the nation's captial while staying as hip and green as possible, and the rest is history.
